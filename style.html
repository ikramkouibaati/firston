                color: teal;  
            }
            h2{ 
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
        <! we created a rulesets>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Heading 1-1</h1>
        <! here for the color value i pasted the hex code for a color i chose from the web page html color code>
        <! we can also use the name of the color that we can copy from the same page >
        <h1>Heading 1-2</h1>
        <h1>Heading 1-3</h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: #8FBC8B;">Heading 2-1</h2>
        <h2 style="font-size:  20px; color: #8FBC8B;">Heading 2-2</h2>
        <h2 style="font-size:  20px; color: #8FBC8B;">Heading 2-3</h2>

        <! now coping ll this over and over feels repetetive , there s a marter way ! is the one used for all h1 above>
        <! the solution = we change from inline styling to ruleset styling >
        <! we create the style elements inside the head elements(these r things that dont show ;)>

        <! NB the most specific style will take presidence , if for example i create a rulesets nd change with inline for the color>
        <! it is the inline color that takes place and the other one is shown crossed on the chrome inspection for the style >

        <! also if i give two different rulesets for the seme element , like giving red and green both for an elmt it's the last written that wins>
