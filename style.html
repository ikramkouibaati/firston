        <! we created a rulesets>
    </head>
    <body>
        <span> Span element </span>
        <h1 class= "uppercase"><span>Heading 1</span>-1</h1> <!how to make one word in an element a different style>
        <! here for the color value i pasted the hex code for a color i chose from the web page html color code>
        <! we can also use the name of the color that we can copy from the same page >
        <h1 class="big ">Heading 1-2</h1>
        <h1>Heading 1-3</h1>
        <! but what if we want some of these elements to be styled differently : give it a class><!the case for h 1-2 >
        <h2 class="big uppercase" >Heading 2-1</h2>
        <h2 style=" color: #8FBC8B;">Heading 2-2</h2>
        <h2  class="big" style=" color: #8FBC8B;">Heading 2-3</h2>

        <! now coping ll this over and over feels repetetive , there s a marter way ! is the one used for all h1 above>
        <! the solution = we change from inline styling to ruleset styling >
        <! we create the style elements inside the head elements(these r things that dont show ;)>

        <! NB the most specific style will take presidence , if for example i create a rulesets nd change with inline for the color>
        <! it is the inline color that takes place and the other one is shown crossed on the chrome inspection for the style >

        <! also if i give two different rulesets for the seme element , like giving red and green both for an elmt it's the last written that wins>

        <! PROBLEM: now if i want to create multiple pages with the same style i ll have to copy the style text and paste it over and over >
        <! which sucks so :: create a file of type css and paste everything inside the style box on it (can use shift+tab to anindent if needed)>
        <! then use instruction in line 5 instead of  style elements (here i had deleted the stylee block)>
